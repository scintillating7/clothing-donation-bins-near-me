# clothing-donation-bins-near-me
Crowd-sourced map of clothing donation bins

# Why:

Once upon a time, my boyfriend and I left our house with an armful of clothing to donate and headed towards where we thought a clothing donation bin was. Alas, when we arrived, it was gone. We looked around, but couldn't see where it moved to. Eventually we got tired of lugging clothes around and walked back to our house. 

If you have a car, driving around where you think you last saw a clothing bin is an option, but if you don't have a car or you don't want to use one, you should still be able to find these bins easily. 

# How this works:

TBD, I am still developing ;)

# My dev plan:

1) Make it pretty 
2) Add some manual boxes
3) Add data to marker: Date added, Date last verified... maybe that you can click on to see more
4) Request your location and/or search box to enter location
5) Ability to add/verify/contest markers
